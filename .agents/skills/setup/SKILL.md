description: Use when installing or refreshing sound taste rules in a project — an explicit "sound setup", starting work in a repo with no .claude/sound/, or a taste-not-defined nudge. Also use to re-run after a stack change (new framework, new package in a monorepo).

# sound:setup

Scaffold a project's taste rules from the sound corpus: probe the stack, select ONLY rules whose subject the repo's code actually shows — evidence-cited per rule, never a tag-wide dump — confirm with the user, then install each confirmed rule's corpus prose verbatim. Each rule lands as a plain reference file in `.claude/sound/<topic>/` — the tree `sound:prime` points at. Written files belong to the user; re-runs reconcile (see Re-runs).

Corpus: `../../corpus/` relative to this SKILL.md — the candidate universe, laid out as `<topic>/<rule>.md`: the directory is the rule's topic, the file is the pure rule body — no frontmatter, no metadata. Sibling `../../corpus-optin/` (same layout) holds opt-in rules, excluded from candidacy unless the user names one at invocation (Phase 2). If `corpus/` is missing or unreadable, STOP and say so — never install a partial set silently.

## Phase 1 — Probe

Decide which kind-tags apply (`react`, `db`, `distributed`) — verified STACK FACTS that anchor Phase 2's per-rule judgment and are presented at Confirm, not a filter that earns any rule an install.

**Usage decides; manifest presence only says where to look.** Verify every hint at its USE sites in source before proposing a tag — deps can be dead weight, hoisted, or tooling-only. Negatives need the same rigor: a client's config/wrapper file never clears a dep; search its use sites (`.publish(`, `.send(`, `.create(`…) before ruling a tag out. Read every `package.json` (root + workspaces) and workspace markers (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`) → hypotheses → verify each in source. Note TS / pure-JS / neither: it sets the TS-only veto (Phase 2) and the no-JS/TS abort (Failure modes).

| Tag | Fires on (verified usage) | Does NOT fire on |
|---|---|---|
| `react` | `.tsx`/`.jsx` files, JSX or react imports in real source | react in deps with zero usage; react-shaped tooling (ink absent too) |
| `db` | a db client or ORM imported in source, whichever one; `redis-as-store`; EMBEDDED dbs with owned DDL/schema (sqlite, node:sqlite, level — in-process still counts); owned schema/migration files | consuming someone else's hosted API without owning storage |
| `distributed` | any SIDE-EFFECTFUL remote boundary: payments, email/SMS, queue/broker publish, webhook handlers, bot messaging SDKs, multiple owned services reconciling state. FRAMEWORK-WRAPPED senders count: an auth provider configured with an SMTP transport, e.g. next-auth EmailProvider, IS email-sending usage even with no direct nodemailer import. Publisher-side evidence alone is SUFFICIENT — the consumer usually lives outside the repo | READ-ONLY consumption of remote APIs (fetch-and-render); analytics beacons; redis as a plain same-process cache (get/set/del only) |

## Phase 2 — Select (per rule, evidence-cited)

Candidates = the ENTIRE `corpus/`. There is no tag pre-filter — each rule's own subject-surface gate below is the selection; the Phase 1 facts are the evidence it judges against.

**Opt-in gate (deterministic).** The candidate universe is `corpus/` ONLY. A `corpus-optin/` rule enters candidacy solely when the user names it at invocation — then read it from `corpus-optin/`. Directory membership is the gate; a default run never proposes an opt-in rule.

A candidate installs iff the repo contains the SUBJECT-SURFACE the rule governs — code where the rule's `Detect:` question is askable — cited as ONE FILE path (never a directory, never a glob). The rule's `Not-when:` can veto. No citation, no install. An actual violation is NOT required (rules are prevention) and its absence never vetoes. Existing COMPLIANCE is evidence FOR install: a repo already doing the mandated shape has the surface.

A fired tag earns NOTHING by itself — each rule's OWN Detect question must be askable at the cited file. A repo that publishes to Redis does not thereby get every distributed rule: with no replicas, no supervised queue, no versioned concurrent writes, the fold/restart-policy/write-conflict rules are skipped, each with its reason.

- Subject-bearing rule: `command-vs-fact-when-reconciled-elsewhere` installs iff the repo has async-reconciled state (a server ack, a queue, a webhook-confirmed flow) — cite the file. A repo that names no events does not get the event-naming rules.
- Universal-subject rule (subject is "any code": naming, transformation shape, comments, function design): passes trivially — cite any substantive source file. Never manufacture deeper evidence.
- A rule whose mandated shape requires TypeScript (casts, branded types, `satisfies`, compile-time exhaustiveness) never installs in a pure-JS repo.
- Candidacy does NOT mean universal-subject: command/event-naming, intent-vs-fact splits, and ledger rules are candidates like everything else but subject-bearing — they need their surface (a named event vocabulary, state reconciled elsewhere, an append-only store).
- Test-scoped rule: its subject is the CODE UNDER TEST, never test-file presence — a zero-test repo with testable logic still earns the general testing rules (cite the testable code). Test rules with a more specific shape (roundtrip laws need encode/decode pairs; property generators need domain invariants) still need THAT shape cited.
- Every rejected candidate gets a one-line reason, surfaced at Confirm.

Method — DEEP by design; spend the tokens. Every candidate rule is judged against its own full text and the real repo, returning per-rule `install + citation` or `skip + reason`. Batching rules that look at the same code across subagents buys parallelism on a large repo; a narrow surface is better served inline — the output SET is what's judged, not the mechanism.

## Phase 3 — Confirm (never skip, never auto-install)

Present compactly: the extracted facts (each with file evidence), the proposed tag set, and the proposed rule set — each rule as name + citation + its one-line statement (never name-only; the user must see what each rule requires) — plus the rejected candidates grouped with their reasons. The statement is the rule's opening mandate: the file's first sentence, extended to the next only when the first merely scopes or defines without stating the mandate (e.g. `derive-dont-sync`, `module-is-the-noun-functions-are-bare-verbs`). Never `_Avoid_`, `Detect:`, or `Not-when:`. The user's answer is the verdict — a corrected set replaces yours without argument; redo the affected phases. Write only after explicit confirmation. The user confirms the SET here; the written files are theirs afterward.

**Propose-only mode:** if the invocation asks for a proposal only (evals, dry runs), read `propose-only.md` and follow it instead of confirming or writing.

## Phase 4 — Write

Copy each confirmed rule's file verbatim — no additions — to `.claude/sound/<topic>/<rule-name>.md`, a plain reference file. `<topic>` is the rule's parent directory in the corpus. These live OUTSIDE `.claude/rules/`, so they never auto-load; the browsable `.claude/sound/` tree IS the map `sound:prime` points at. No marker, manifest, or hash anywhere.

## Re-runs

If `.claude/sound/` already exists, read `re-runs.md` before writing anything — existing files are user-owned and are reconciled, never overwritten.

## Failure modes to keep loud

- Corpus unreachable / rule file unparseable → stop before writing anything.
- User declines all tags → Phase 2 still runs over the full corpus; rules whose surface lives behind a declined tag are skipped with that reason. Say that's what happened.
- Repo has no JS/TS at all → the corpus doesn't apply; say so and install nothing.
- A selected rule with no citable evidence is a selection BUG — drop it and say so, never install on vibes.
