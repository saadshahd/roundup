# Perf

Rule 7's budgets and what measures each. Linux VM numbers are Linux numbers. The macOS baseline was recorded on a laptop in ordinary use (load 4 to 7 on 16 cores, 0.25 to 0.45 per core), not an idle one, so it is a baseline for that machine under that load.

| Budget | Measured by | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Daemon cold start < 300 ms | `just perf` (`cold_start_ms`: spawn `rupd` to its first `daemon.ping` reply) | any machine; the App's cold start to a visible window is manual |
| 10 idle Agents < 150 MB extra RSS | `just perf` (`rss_extra_mb`: the Daemon's growth with ten login-shell Terminals) | any machine; the Agents' own processes are manual |
| Keystroke-to-render < 16 ms p95 | `just perf-keystroke`, only when the user asks (below) | the macOS App only |
| Regression above 10% fails | `just perf` against `crates/perf/budgets.json` | same OS as the baseline |

`just perf` runs a fresh Daemon 11 times, takes each metric's median, prints the range and each run's load average, writes `target/perf.json` and exits 1 on a miss. Run it on a quiet machine: load is printed so a noisy run can be thrown away. A metric fails above its `limit`, or above its OS's `baseline` by more than 10% plus its `noise` allowance.

## What is enforced, and what is not

Rule 7's 10% regression test is enforced for five metrics on Linux and five on macOS (below), and is a gross tripwire for the rest. A latency miss on macOS is rerun on a quiet machine before it is believed. Measured on an isolated 2-vCPU boxd VM (AMD EPYC, load 2 to 4 from the runs themselves): 9 invocations of 11 runs each, the spread of the 9 medians against their median was

| Metric | max / median | min / median | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rss_extra_mb` | 1.05 | 0.93 | 10% + 0.05 MB |
| `ping_p95_ms` | 1.13 | 0.96 | 10% + 0.001 ms |
| `rail_tree_40_p95_ms` | 1.06 | 0.97 | 10% + 0.001 ms |
| `terminal_write_p95_ms` | 1.04 | 0.88 | 10% + 0.001 ms |
| `write_to_output_p95_ms` | 1.09 | 0.96 | 10% + 0.001 ms, limit 16 ms |
| `cold_start_ms` | 3.08 | 0.57 | limit 300 ms only: its median varies 3x between identical invocations, so no 10% test can hold |
| `rail_tree_10_p95_ms` | 1.66 | 0.51 | limit 2 ms only (about 8x its median): same reason |

`noise` is an absolute floor for the clock's resolution, not slack: it is 0.05 MB on a 1.6 MB metric and 1 microsecond on latencies of 25 to 265 microseconds. The worst observed ratio (1.13, `ping`) is a 0.5 microsecond overshoot that the floor covers; with only 9 invocations, one false fail in a few dozen runs is expected, so rerun before believing a single fail. The `linux` baselines are the medians of those 9 invocations and are valid for that VM class only. The `macos` baselines are in the next section; the `limit`s hold anywhere. To accept a new baseline, copy the medians from `target/perf.json` into `budgets.json` under the OS name in the same PR that explains why. See `scenarios/perf.md` (R1 to R10).

## macOS baseline

Recorded on one Apple M4 Max laptop (16 cores); the key is the OS only, so the numbers are valid for that machine class: `macos-latest` in CI or a slower Mac would be judged against an M4 Max and needs its own baseline before it is gated with the machine in ordinary use: load average 4 to 7, which is 0.25 to 0.45 per core, not idle (a developer's laptop is never idle); 9 invocations of 11 runs each. The spread of the 9 medians against their median:

| Metric | max / median | Gate on macOS |
|---|---|---|
| `cold_start_ms` | 1.07 | 10% + 0.3 ms, limit 300 ms (Linux: limit only) |
| `rss_extra_mb` | 1.01 | 10% + 0.05 MB, limit 150 MB |
| `rail_tree_40_p95_ms` | 1.07 | 10% + 0.001 ms |
| `terminal_write_p95_ms` | 1.09 | 10% + 0.001 ms |
| `write_to_output_p95_ms` | 1.09 | 10% + 0.001 ms, limit 16 ms |
| `ping_p95_ms` | 1.19 | none: 4 microseconds of jitter on 24 is 19% |
| `rail_tree_10_p95_ms` | 1.19 | none: same |
| keystroke p95 in WKWebView (`just perf-keystroke`) | 11 to 14 ms across 9 runs of 1000 keys | limit 16 ms only: it is whole milliseconds and a frame is 16.7 ms, so 10% is under one tick |

macOS cold start is stable (1.07) where the Linux VM's was not (3.08), so it is gated here.

**Load changes latency far more than 10%.** The same 7 metrics with 8 busy loops running (load 7 to 14): cold start x1.4, `ping` x2.1, `write_to_output` x2.2, `rail.tree` 10 Groups x8, 40 Groups x1.0 to 1.9 and widely spread; `rss_extra_mb` did not move (3.10 against a median of 3.14, committed as 3.1 because clippy rejects a literal that looks like pi). So a latency miss on a busy machine proves nothing, and a memory miss proves a lot.

**Observed false fail.** A `just perf` at load 7.5 (the baseline's loads were 4 to 6) put `write_to_output_p95_ms` at 0.064 ms against a ceiling of 0.063 ms and failed; nothing had regressed. The gate does not yet know the load: until it skips latency comparisons above a load per core (only proposed, as R13 in docs PR #97; not built), a latency miss is rerun when the machine is quieter before it is believed.

**A latency miss on macOS is rerun on a quiet machine before it is believed; a memory miss is believed at any load.**

**Real regression or noise.** Look at the load printed for each run first. A real regression moves the median above the ceiling in three reruns at the load of the baseline (up to about 0.45 per core) and does not track the load; noise falls back under the ceiling when the machine quiets, and the miss and the load rise together. A memory miss is real whatever the load. Re-baseline only with a PR that says why (copy the medians from `target/perf.json`).

## Keystroke-to-render in WKWebView

> **This opens a window over your screen and types into it.** The window is always on top and on every Space for about 40 s per run (three runs by default), and it never takes the keyboard focus on purpose, but it covers whatever you are doing. `just perf-keystroke` and `perf-keystroke` refuse unless `ROUNDUP_ALLOW_WINDOW=1` is set, and it is set only by someone the user asked to run it (R12). No agent, Reviewer, CI job, boxd VM or `just check` runs it.

What the number proves: keydown to the first xterm render that shows the echo, in the real WKWebView on macOS, with the renderer and mean frame time recorded. What it does not: it is not a CI gate and not a Linux number, it excludes the keyboard, OS event path and display scan-out, `performance.now()` is a 1 ms bound, and p95 in whole milliseconds makes a 10% test move in 1 ms steps, so its budget is the 16 ms limit only. The cheap headless bound is the Daemon-side `write_to_output_p95_ms` limit of 16 ms in `just perf` (R8).

`just perf-keystroke` (macOS only) builds the App with the keystroke probe (`VITE_ROUNDUP_PERF`, K1) into `target/perf-app`, opens its window once per run, lets the webview type 1000 keys into a raw `cat` Terminal and reads the result back (K3, R11). The number is keydown to the first xterm render that shows the echo: it excludes the display's scan-out, and `performance.now()` has 1 ms resolution in WKWebView. The report carries the renderer (`webgl` or `dom`) and the mean frame time.

What can go wrong:
- **A covered or napped window stops drawing.** macOS stops rAF and timers for a window other windows cover and naps an App that is not frontmost: measured here, with the window behind a full-screen Chrome, rendering stopped entirely and every key timed out. The perf build's window is therefore always on top and on every Space (a `TAURI_CONFIG` override in the recipe, so normal builds are unchanged), and the runner passes `-NSAppSleepDisabled YES`. The window stays over whatever you are doing for about 40 s per run, three runs. A throttled run is refused, not reported: mean frame time above 25 ms or more than 5% dropped keys exits 2.
- **Load.** Run it with the laptop idle; the load average is printed per run.
- **Windows over a headless Chromium number.** Chromium with the same xterm measured p95 under 5 ms; WKWebView on an M4 Max in the earlier spike measured 11 to 15 ms. The difference is the frame wait, so the budget is only meaningful here.
