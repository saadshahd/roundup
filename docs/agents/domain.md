# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase. roundup is single-context: one glossary at the repo root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root. Where a skill says `CONTEXT.md`, read `GLOSSARY.md`.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to its _Avoid_ words.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (add the term through `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0003 (daemon JSON-RPC over a Unix socket) — but worth reopening because…_
