A function's signature must carry every fact a caller needs to use it correctly — not just a name that reads well, but preconditions, ordering constraints, every error mode, and any performance cliff a caller could hit by surprise.
_Avoid_: bare `number`/`string` params standing in for units, currencies, or IDs that carry caller obligations; error modes documented only in a comment or README instead of the return type.
Detect: a public function whose parameter or return type could be satisfied by a caller who hasn't read the implementation, but who would still misuse it — ambiguous units, missing idempotency signal, error cases absent from the type.
Not-when: private helpers with a single, already-informed call site inside the same module — the contract there is enforced by proximity, not by the type.
Cross-ref: remote-call-has-a-third-outcome — the `unknown` arm a process-boundary contract must carry.
