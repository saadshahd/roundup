Export only what a caller currently needs from a module's namespace object — every export is a permanent promise, since removing one later is a breaking change for every caller, internal or external.
_Avoid_: exporting a helper "in case something needs it later"; re-exporting a dependency's type or function through your namespace just because it was convenient at the call site.
Detect: an exported member of a namespace object with zero import sites outside its own module, or a re-export whose only purpose is passthrough.
Not-when: the module is an explicitly designated public entry point (e.g., a package's `index.ts`) whose whole job is re-exporting a curated surface.
