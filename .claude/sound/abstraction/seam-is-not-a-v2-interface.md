A seam introduced to make code testable is an internal implementation detail with one call-site contract, not a second public interface living alongside the first — don't let "add a seam" become "add a v2 API and deprecate the v1 one."
_Avoid_: `*V2`, `*New`, `*Next` function/class names; two call-site conventions for what is conceptually one operation
Detect: two functions/exports with near-identical names and overlapping purpose where one is described as "new" or "replacement" and both remain callable
Not-when: never — a seam that requires a parallel interface to exist isn't a seam, it's an unfinished migration (atomicity-three-regimes governs the transition mechanic when one is genuinely needed).
