A call that crosses a process boundary resolves to `ok | failed | unknown` — never a two-way `ok | failed`. A timeout means the request may have been applied; the caller must be able to branch on "don't know."
_Avoid_: a `Result<T, E>` two-arm union as the return type of a network/RPC/queue call; treating a timeout as a `failed` arm.
Detect: a function that awaits a network/RPC/DB-over-network call and whose return type has no arm distinct from clean failure for "timed out / no response." At a remote boundary, "unknown" is a surfacing failure the caller genuinely must branch on — it cannot be defined out of existence or masked at a lower layer.
Not-when: in-process calls, or genuinely idempotent reads where re-issuing is free (then a retry loop masks it at the lowest layer — step 2 of eliminate-mask-then-surface's ladder).
Cross-ref: eliminate-mask-then-surface — the error-handling order this specializes for `[distributed]`, where "unknown" is the one arm that must reach the caller.
