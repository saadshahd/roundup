Actions that recompute derived state do NOT share the `set*` prefix with direct writes. Name them by the computation — `computeTotals`, `deriveLineups` — never `setComputedTotals`. `set*` means a caller-supplied write; recomputation is a different act.
_Avoid_: a `set*` name whose body derives its value from existing state rather than storing a value the caller passed in.
Detect: a `set*` function that takes no value argument (or ignores it) and instead reads other state to compute what it writes — the `set` prefix is lying about a recomputation.
Not-when: the function genuinely stores a caller-supplied value (`setName(name)`) — then `set*` is correct.
