A function's name describes what it DOES, not where it's USED, and makes sense without knowing the caller. If removing the call site makes the name nonsensical, the name is wrong.
_Avoid_: names that embed a call site, an event, or a feature — `handle*Click`, `*ForCartItem`, `*OnSubmit`, `*ForModal`.
Detect: read the name with every call site deleted; if it no longer describes the operation, it encodes a caller. UI-event prefixes (`handle`, `on`) and `For<Feature>` suffixes on non-handler functions are a first-pass filter.
Not-when: a genuine DOM/framework event handler whose whole job is to bridge an event — a bare `onClick` prop handler may legitimately read as `handleSubmit` at the boundary.
