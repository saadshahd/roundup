Each test names and proves exactly one behavior; multiple unrelated `expect` blocks in one `it` means it's actually several tests wearing a trenchcoat.
_Avoid_: a test name that's a noun phrase ("order validation") instead of a claim; 3+ `expect`s covering different inputs in one `it`.
Detect: an `it`/`test` block whose assertions reference more than one distinct input fixture, or whose title uses "and"/commas to join unrelated claims.
Not-when: multiple assertions all check facets of ONE outcome from ONE input (e.g. `expect(result.status).toBe('ok'); expect(result.total).toBe(500)` on the same call) — that's one behavior, several assertions.
Cross-ref: near-identical-examples-signal-an-unextracted-property — before splitting into more `it` blocks, ask: do the cases differ in code PATH (branch taken / error type) or only in LITERALS? Path → keep them as named examples; literals → collapse to one extracted property instead of many tests.
